The nRF Desktop application is modular.
Depending on requested functions, it can provide mouse, keyboard, or dongle functionality.
The selection of modules depends on the chosen role and also on the selected reference design.
For more information about modules available for each configuration, see :ref:`nrf_desktop_architecture`.

For a board to be supported by the application, you must provide a set of configuration files at :file:`applications/nrf_desktop/configuration/your_board_name`.
The application configuration files define both a set of options with which the nRF Desktop application will be created for your board and the selected :ref:`nrf_desktop_requirements_build_types`.
Include the following files in this directory:

Mandatory configuration files
    * Application configuration file for the :ref:`debug build type <nrf_desktop_requirements_build_types>`.
    * Configuration files for the selected modules.

Optional configuration files
    * Application configuration files for other build types.
    * Configuration file for the bootloader.
    * Configuration file for the sysbuild.
    * Memory layout configuration.
    * DTS overlay file.

See :ref:`porting_guide_adding_board` for information about how to add these files.

nRF Desktop board configuration files
*************************************

The nRF Desktop application comes with configuration files for the following reference designs:

Sample mouse or keyboard (``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l05/cpuapp``)
      * The configuration :ref:`emulates the nRF54L05 SoC <zephyr:nrf54l15dk_nrf54l05>` on the nRF54L15 DK.
      * The build types allow to build the application as a mouse or a keyboard.
      * Inputs are simulated based on the hardware button presses.
      * On the nRF54L05 SoC, you can only use the **GPIO1** port for PWM hardware peripheral output.
        Because of that, on the DK PCA10156 revision v0.9.3, **LED 0** and **LED 2** cannot be used for PWM output.
        You can still use these LEDs with the PWM LED driver, but you must set the LED color to ``LED_COLOR(255, 255, 255)`` or ``LED_COLOR(0, 0, 0)``.
        This ensures the PWM peripheral is not used for the mentioned LEDs.
      * Only Bluetooth LE transport is enabled.
        Bluetooth LE is configured to use Nordic Semiconductor's SoftDevice Link Layer and Low Latency Packet Mode (LLPM).
      * The preconfigured ``debug`` configuration does not use the bootloader due to memory size limits.
        In the ``debug`` configuration, logs are provided through the UART.
        For detailed information on working with the nRF54L15 DK, see the :ref:`ug_nrf54l15_gs` documentation.
      * The preconfigured ``release`` configurations use the MCUboot bootloader built in the direct-xip mode (``MCUBOOT+XIP``) and support firmware updates using the :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu`.
        All of the ``release`` configurations enable hardware cryptography for the MCUboot bootloader.
        The application image is verified using a pure ED25519 signature.
        The public key that MCUboot uses for validating the application image is securely stored in the hardware Key Management Unit (KMU).
        For more details about KMU, see :ref:`ug_kmu_guides`.
      * The board supports the ``release`` :ref:`nrf_desktop_bluetooth_guide_fast_pair` configuration that acts as a mouse  (``release_fast_pair`` file suffix).

        USB High-Speed is configured to use the USB next stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_STACK_NEXT`).
        The :option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_ADV_CTRL_ENABLE` and :option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_ADV_CTRL_SUSPEND_ON_USB` Kconfig options are enabled in mouse configurations to improve the HID report rate over USB.

        For detailed information on working with the nRF54LM20 DK, see the :ref:`ug_nrf54l15_gs` documentation.
      * In ``llvm`` configurations, the partition layout is different to accommodate for the higher memory footprint of the ``llvm``  toolchain.
      * The ``debug``, ``release``, and ``llvm`` configurations use the MCUboot bootloader built in the direct-xip mode (``MCUBOOT+XIP``) and support firmware updates using the :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu`.

        For more details about KMU, see :ref:`ug_kmu_guides`.
      * The ``ram_load`` and ``release_ram_load`` configurations use the MCUboot bootloader built in the RAM load mode (``MCUBOOT``) and support firmware updates using the :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu`.
        Configurations in this bootloader mode use the same security features as direct-xip mode (``MCUBOOT+XIP``), including hardware cryptography, signature type, and public key storage.
        The application code is executed from the RAM in this mode to improve the HID report rate over USB.
        For more details on the RAM load mode, see the MCUboot :ref:`nrf_desktop_configuring_mcuboot_bootloader_ram_load` documentation section.
